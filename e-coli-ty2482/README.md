`.tsv` files with some data of the proteins from the plasmid `pTY1` from _E. coli_ TY-2482. Particularly length and connectivity degree.

Connectivity degree is measured as the number of proteins with the exact same sequence as the sequence from the plasmid.

Proteins are sorted by their position in the plasmid
